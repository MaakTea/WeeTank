# WeeTank
a project similar to wii tanks


ToDo:
- AI: stop pushing walls. options/parts
  - detect collision to wall/obstacle or being held back, and do something about it
  - detect visibility to target
  - use navmesh
- stop tanks turning over
  - change movement to use physics forces instead of small teleports
- separate MOVE target and AIM target for tanks :) 

- keep working on new AI
- hits to actually deal damage, destroy tanks
- win/lose (game over) condition and (re)start (next) level

- destructable walls
- powerups OR upgrades between rounds
